# README

reactjs-start is a basic ReactJS-Startproject including browserify for bundling and http-server for development.

## First Steps
Clone this repository and run `npm install` to get all dependencies.

## Scripts
### build
`npm run build` bundles all .js-files into public/app.js

### watch
`npm run watch` similar to build but works incremental. Recommended during development process.

### server
`npm run server` starts a http-server to serve the webapp on http://localhost:8080.

Flag `-c-1` is set to disable cache.
